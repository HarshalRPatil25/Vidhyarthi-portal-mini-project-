        <ul>Attendance is one of those administrative tasks that must be done at the start of each lecture.
            Our system is designed to be easy to use and efficient, with features that include automatic attendance
            inserting and customizable attendance policies.
            We believe that our system can help to improve attendance rates, reduce errors and confusion, and provide a
            more accurate record of student attendance.
            We worked closely with teachers, students to gather feedback and ensure that our system meets the needs of
            all stakeholders.<br>
            &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;We are constantly striving to improve and expand the capabilities of our system,
            and we have ambitious plans for the future.
            We hope that our college attendance management system will be a valuable tool for educators and students
            alike, and we look forward to seeing the positive impact it will have on attendance and academic outcomes.

            of absences and tardies.

            educational facilities. <br>

            As teachers, <br> &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;&emsp;we understand the importance of attendance in the
            classroom.
            Not only is it essential for students to be present in order to learn and participate in class, but it is
            also a key factor in academic performance and outcomes.
            That's why we developed the college attendance management system - to make it easier for teachers to track
            attendance and for students to stay on top of their attendance records.
            Teacher has authority to upload attendance as well as Marks . Teacher also upload and delete the college
            timetable , University exam timetable , syllabus pdf and etc.<br>

            check in to class.
            That's why we appreciate the convenience and accessibility of the college attendance management system.
